# Question Generator

This project is a Streamlit-based application that generates different types of questions (Multiple Choice, True/False, and Descriptive) from a text document. It uses the OpenAI API to generate questions based on the content of uploaded PDF or text files, and allows users to specify the number of questions, the subject, and the complexity level.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Generates MCQs with specified complexity and tone.
- **True/False Questions**: Generates True/False questions.
- **Descriptive Questions**: Generates descriptive questions that are more detailed and require explanation.
- **File Upload**: Supports uploading of PDF and text files to extract content for question generation.
- **Customization**: Users can specify the number of questions, subject, and tone of the generated questions.
