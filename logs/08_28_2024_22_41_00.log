Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.

Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)   \nObjective \n1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe: \n(a) When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events \nafter the reporting  period; and \n(b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the \nfinancial statements were approved for issue and about events \nafter the reporting period. \nThe Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial \nstatements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period \nindicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate. \nScope \n2 This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and \ndisclosure of, events after the reporting period. \nDefinitions \n3 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings \nspecified:  \nEvents after the reporting period  are those events, favourable and \nunfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period \nand the date when the financial statements are approved by the \nBoard of Directors in case of a company, and, by the \ncorresponding approving authority in case of any other entity for \nissue. Two types of events can be identified: \n(a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the \n \n# This Ind AS was notified vide G.S.R. 111(E) dated 16th February, 2015 and was amended \nvide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n end of the reporting period ( adjusting events after the \nreporting period ); and \n(b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the \nreporting period ( non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod). \nNotwithstanding anything contained above, where there is a breach \nof a material provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or \nbefore the end of the reporting period with the effect that the \nliability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the \nagreement by lender before the approval of the financial \nstatements for issue, to not demand payment as a consequence of \nthe breach, shall be considered as an adjusting event. \n4 The process involved in approving the financial statements for issue will \nvary depending upon the management structure, statutory requirements \nand procedures followed in preparing and finalising the financial \nstatements. \n5 In some cases, an entity is required to submit its financial statements to \nits shareholders for approval after the financial statements have been \napproved by the Board for issue. In such cases, the financial statements \nare approved for issue on the date of approval by the Board, not the \ndate when shareholders approve the financial statements. \n6 In some cases, the management of an entity is required to issue its \nfinancial statements to a supervisory board (made up solely of non-\nexecutives) for approval. In such cases, the financial statements are \napproved for issue when the management approves them for issue to \nthe supervisory board.  \nExample \nOn 18 March 20X2, the management of an entity approves financial \nstatements for issue to its supervisory board. The supervisory board is \nmade up solely of non-executives and may include representatives of \nemployees and other outside interests. The supervisory board \napproves the financial statements on 26 March 20X2. The financial \nstatements are made available to shareholders and others on 1 April \n20X2. The shareholders approve the financial statements at their \nannual meeting on 15 May 20X2 and the financial statements are then  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n filed with a regulatory body on 17 May 20X2.  \nThe financial statements are approved for issue on 18 March 20X2 \n(date of management approval for issue to the supervisory board).  \n7 Events after the reporting period include all events up to the date when \nthe financial statements are approved for issue, even if those events \noccur after the public announcement of profit or of other selected \nfinancial information. \nRecognition and measurement \nAdjusting events after the reporting period \n8 An entity shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. \n9 The following are examples of adjusting events after the reporting period \nthat require an entity to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised: \n(a) the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that \nconfirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the \nreporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised \nprovision related to this court case in accordance with Ind AS 37, \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  or \nrecognises a new provision. The entity does not merely disclose a \ncontingent liability because the settlement provides additional \nevidence that would be considered in accordance with paragraph \n16 of Ind AS 37. \n(b) the receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that \nan asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that \nthe amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that \nasset needs to be adjusted. For example: \n(i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting \nperiod usually confirms that the customer was credit-\nimpaired at the end of the reporting period; and \n(ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give \nevidence about their net realisable value at the end of the \nreporting period. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n (c) the determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets \npurchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of \nthe reporting period. \n(d) the determination after the reporting period of the amount of \nprofit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal \nor constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to \nmake such payments as a result of events before that date (see \nInd AS 19, Employee Benefits).  \n(e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial \nstatements are incorrect. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n10 An entity shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial \nstatements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod. \n11 An example of a non-adjusting event after the reporting period is a \ndecline in fair value of investments between the end of the reporting \nperiod and the date when the financial statements are approved for \nissue. The decline in fair value does not normally relate to the condition \nof the investments at the end of the reporting period, but reflects \ncircumstances that have arisen subsequently. Therefore, an entity does \nnot adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the \ninvestments. Similarly, the entity does not update the amounts disclosed \nfor the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may \nneed to give additional disclosure under paragraph 21. \nDividends  \n12 If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as \ndefined in  Ind AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation ) after the \nreporting period, the entity shall not recognise those dividends as \na liability at the end of the reporting period.  \n13 If dividends are declared after the reporting period but before the \nfinancial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are not \nrecognised as a liability at the end of the reporting period because no \nobligation exists at that time. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes \nin accordance with Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n Going concern \n14 An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going \nconcern basis if management determines after the reporting period \neither that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or \nthat it has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n15 Deterioration in operating results and financial position after the \nreporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going \nconcern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption \nis no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard \nrequires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than \nan adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of \naccounting. \n16 Ind AS 1 specifies required disclosures if: \n(a) the financial statements are not prepared on a going concern \nbasis; or \n(b) management is aware of material uncertainties related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s \nability to continue as a going concern. The events or conditions \nrequiring disclosure may arise after the reporting period. \nDisclosure \nDate of approval for issue \n17 An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements \nwere approved for issue and who gave that approval. If the entity’s \nowners or others have the power to amend the financial statements \nafter issue, the entity shall disclose that fact. \n18 It is important for users to know when the financial statements were \napproved for issue, because the financial statements do not reflect \nevents after this date. \n \nUpdating disclosure about conditions at the end of \nthe reporting period \n19 If an entity receives information after the reporting period about Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall \nupdate disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of \nthe new information. \n20 In some cases, an entity needs to update the disclosures in its financial \nstatements to reflect information received after the reporting period, \neven when the information does not affect the amounts that it \nrecognises in its financial statements. One example of the need to \nupdate disclosures is when evidence becomes available after the \nreporting period about a contingent liability that existed at the end of the \nreporting period. In addition to considering whether it should recognise \nor change a provision under Ind AS 37, an entity updates its disclosures \nabout the contingent liability in the light of that evidence. \nNon-adjusting events after the reporting period \n21 1If non-adjusting events after the reporting period are material, non-\ndisclosure could reasonably be expected to influence decisions \nthat the primary users of general purpose financial statements \nmake on the basis of those financial statements, which provide \nfinancial information about a specific reporting entity. Accordingly, \nan entity shall disclose the following for each material category of \nnon-adjusting event after the reporting period- \n(a) the nature of the event; and  \n(b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an \nestimate cannot be made. \n22 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the reporting \nperiod that would generally result in disclosure: \n(a) a major business combination after the reporting period Ind AS \n103, Business Combinations,  requires specific disclosures in such \ncases) or disposing of a major subsidiary; \n(b) announcing a plan to discontinue an operation; \n(c) major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for \nsale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for \nSale and Discontinued Operations , other disposals of assets, or \nexpropriation of major assets by government; \n \n1 Substituted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the \nreporting period; \n(e) announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major \nrestructuring (see Ind AS 37); \n(f) major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share \ntransactions after the reporting period (Ind AS 33, Earnings per \nShare, requires an entity to disclose a description of such \ntransactions, other than when such transactions involve \ncapitalisation or bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits \nall of which are required to be adjusted under  Ind AS 33); \n(g) abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset \nprices or foreign exchange rates; \n(h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the \nreporting period that have a significant effect on current and \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities (see Ind AS 12, Income Taxes ); \n(i)  entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for \nexample, by issuing significant guarantees; and \n(j)  commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that \noccurred after the reporting period. \n2Effective date   \n23-23B [Refer Appendix 1] \n23C  Definition of Material  (Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8), \namended paragraph 21.

Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix A  \nDistribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners3 \nThis Appendix is an integral part of the Ind AS. \nBackground \n1 Sometimes an entity distributes assets other than cash (non-cash \nassets) as dividends to its owners4 acting in their capacity as owners. In \nthose situations, an entity may also give its owners a choice of receiving \neither non-cash assets or a cash alternative.  \n2 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) do not provide guidance on how \nan entity should measure distributions to its owners (commonly referred \nto as dividends). Ind AS 1 requires an entity to present details of \ndividends recognised as distributions to owners either in the statement \nof changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements. \nScope \n3 This Appendix applies to the following types of non-reciprocal \ndistributions of assets by an entity to its owners acting in their capacity \nas owners: \n(a) distributions of non-cash assets (eg items of property, plant and \nequipment,  businesses as defined in Ind AS 103, ownership \ninterests in another entity or disposal groups as defined in Ind AS \n105); and \n(b) distributions that give owners a choice of receiving either non-\ncash assets or a  cash alternative. \n4 This Appendix applies only to distributions in which all owners of the \nsame class of equity instruments are treated equally. \n5 This Appendix does not apply to a distribution of a non-cash asset that \nis ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the \ndistribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and \n \n3 This Appendix deals, inter alia, with when to recognise dividends payable to its owners. \n4 Paragraph 7 of Ind AS 1 defines owners as holders of instruments classified as equity.  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n consolidated financial statements of an entity that makes the \ndistribution. \n6 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when the \nnon-cash asset is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before \nand after the distribution. Paragraph 7 of Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 \nstates that ‘A group of individuals shall be regarded as controlling an \nentity when, as a result of contractual arrangements, they collectively \nhave the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to \nobtain benefits from its activities, and that ultimate collective power is \nnot transitory.’ Therefore, for a distribution to be outside the scope of \nthis Appendix on the basis that the same parties control the asset both \nbefore and after the distribution, a group of individual shareholders \nreceiving the distribution must have, as a result of contractual \narrangements, such ultimate collective power over the entity making the \ndistribution. \n7 In accordance with paragraph 5, this Appendix does not apply when an \nentity distributes some of its ownership interests in a subsidiary but \nretains control of the subsidiary. The entity making a distribution that \nresults in the entity recognising a non-controlling interest in its \nsubsidiary accounts for the distribution in accordance with Ind AS 110. \n8 This Appendix addresses only the accounting by an entity that makes a \nnon-cash asset distribution. It does not address the accounting by \nshareholders who receive such a distribution. \nIssues \n9 When an entity declares a distribution and has an obligation to distribute \nthe assets concerned to its owners, it must recognise a liability for the \ndividend payable. Consequently, this Appendix addresses the following \nissues: \n(a) When should the entity recognise the dividend payable? \n(b) How should an entity measure the dividend payable? \n(c) When an entity settles the dividend payable, how should it \naccount for any difference between the carrying amount of the \nassets distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable? Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Accounting Principles \nWhen to recognise a dividend payable \n10 The liability to pay a dividend shall be recognised when the dividend is \nappropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity, \nwhich is the date: \n(a) when declaration of the dividend, eg by management or the board \nof directors, is approved by the relevant authority, eg the \nshareholders, if the jurisdiction requires such approval, or \n(b) when the dividend is declared, eg by management or the board of \ndirectors, if the jurisdiction does not require further approval. \nMeasurement of a dividend payable \n11 An entity shall measure a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a \ndividend to its owners at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n12 If an entity gives its owners a choice of receiving either a non-cash \nasset or a cash alternative, the entity shall estimate the dividend \npayable by considering both the fair value of each alternative and the \nassociated probability of owners selecting each alternative. \n13 At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the \nentity shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable, with any changes in the carrying amount of the dividend \npayable recognised in equity as adjustments to the amount of the \ndistribution. \n Accounting for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets \ndistributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable when an \nentity settles the dividend payable \n14 When an entity settles the dividend payable, it shall recognise the \ndifference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assets distributed \nand the carrying amount of the dividend payable in profit or loss. \nPresentation and disclosures \n15 An entity shall present the difference described in paragraph 14 as a \nseparate line item in profit or loss. \n16 An entity shall disclose the following information, if applicable:  Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period  \n (a) the carrying amount of the dividend payable at the beginning and \nend of the period; and \n(b) the increase or decrease in the carrying amount recognised in the \nperiod in accordance with paragraph 13 as result of a change in \nthe fair value of the assets to be distributed. \n17 If, after the end of a reporting period but before the financial statements \nare approved for issue, an entity declares a dividend to distribute a non-\ncash asset, it shall disclose: \n(a) the nature of the asset to be distributed; \n(b) the carrying amount of the asset to be distributed as of the end of \nthe reporting period; and \n(c) the  fair value of the asset to be distributed as of the end of the \nreporting  period, if it is different from its carrying amount, and the \ninformation about the method(s) used to measure that fair value \nrequired by  paragraphs 93(b), (d), (g) and (i) and 99 of Ind AS \n113. Ind AS 10, Events after the Reporting Period \n Appendix 1 \nNote: This Appendix is not a part of the Indian Accounting Standard. The purpose \nof this Appendix is only to bring out the major differences, if any, between Indian \nAccounting Standard (Ind AS) 10 and the corresponding International Accounting \nStandard (IAS) 10,  Events after the Reporting Period, and IFRIC 17, Distributions of \nNon-cash Assets to Owners, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \nComparison with IAS 10, Events after the \nReporting Period, and IFRIC 17 \n1 Different terminology is used in this standard, eg, the term ‘balance \nsheet’ is used instead of ‘Statement of financial position’. The words \n‘approval of the financial statements for issue’ have been used instead \nof ‘authorisation of the financial statements for issue’ in the context of \nfinancial statements considered for the purpose of events after the \nreporting period.  \n2 Consequent to changes made in Ind AS 1, it has been provided in the \ndefinition of ‘Events after the reporting period’  that in case of breach of a \nmaterial provision of a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable \non demand on the reporting date, if the lender, before the approval of \nthe financial statements for issue, agrees to waive the breach, it shall be \nconsidered as an adjusting event. \n3 5Paragraphs 23-23B of IAS 10 related to Effective Date have not been \nincluded in Ind AS 10 as these are not relevant in Indian context. However, \nin order to maintain consistency with paragraph numbers of IAS 10, these \nparagraph numbers are retained in Ind AS 10. \n \n5 Inserted vide Notification No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 24th July, 2020.
